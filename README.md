# Pac-man :

## Description :

The main goal of this school project was to discover the C library ncurses that allows the developer to create an interactive terminal. 
The original goal was to re-code a small japan puzzle game : Sokoban. 

To improve the original project, I re-coded an other game : pac-man, which allowed me to improve in matters of artificial intelligence and pseudo rando.

## How to use :

First you need to install the ncurses library.

Then it's very simple :
   * To get some information about the game : ./my_pac_man -h
   * To play : ./my_pac_man maps/original_1

*Tips : You can create your own maps !*
