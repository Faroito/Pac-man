# Pac-man :

## Description :

The main goal of this project was to descover ncurses (library that allows the devoleper to create an iteractive terminal). 
The original project was to re-code a small japan puzzle game : Sokoban. 

To improve this Epitech's project, I re-code an other game : pac-man, which allow me to discover the artificial intelligence and pseudo random.

## How to use :

First you need to install the ncurses library.

Then it's very simple :
     - To have some information about the game : ./my_pac_man -h
     - To play : ./my_pac_man maps/original_1

*Tips : You can create your own maps !*


## About the Epitech's C norm :

As a Epitech's student, I have to use a specific norme in C for all my project. 

That why all the functions look the same, we also can't have more than 5 function in a file, 25 line in a function and more than 80 character in a line.
